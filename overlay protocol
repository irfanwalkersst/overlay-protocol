**Thread: Exploring Overlay Protocol with Move Language Integration 🚀**

1/6 🌐 **Introduction to Overlay Protocol**  
Overlay Protocol provides advanced infrastructure for scalable and secure DeFi applications. It leverages Move language for enhanced smart contract functionality and security.

2/6 🗂️ **Move Language Overview**  
Move is a statically-typed programming language designed for secure smart contracts and blockchain operations. It features strong type safety and formal verification to ensure reliable execution.

3/6 🔍 **Move Features in Overlay Protocol**  
- **Resource Types:** Prevents asset duplication and enforces correct usage.
- **Formal Verification:** Ensures smart contract logic is free of vulnerabilities through mathematical proofs.

4/6 🛠️ **Example Code from GitHub**  
Here’s a snippet of Overlay Protocol’s Move-based smart contract, showcasing basic operations:

```move
module OverlayProtocol::Vault {
    public fun deposit(amount: u64) {
        // Code to deposit assets into the vault
    }

    public fun withdraw(amount: u64) {
        // Code to withdraw assets from the vault
    }

    public fun get_balance(): u64 {
        // Code to check the balance in the vault
    }
}
```

5/6 🔧 **Integration Details**  
The integration with Move enhances Overlay Protocol’s capabilities by ensuring security and efficiency. Move’s formal verification helps in validating complex DeFi logic, while resource types prevent misuse of assets.
